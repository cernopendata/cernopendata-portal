With the growing demand for open research data and an increased interest in the CERN Open Data portal, we have been working hard on modernising our web presence and services. Here, you can learn more about the changes we have made and how you can use our updated portal.

CERN Open Data provides content for both education and research. We aim to support high-school students and teachers as well as university students and professors. For this purpose, the new design of CERN Open Data is article-driven. Detailed [guides](/search?type=Documentation&subtype=Guide) introduce you to physics analyses that make use of [datasets available from this portal](/search?type=Dataset). Event displays allow you to visualise collision data and examine what happens when particles interact in high-energy collisions.

While we had educators, students and the wider public in mind when we redesigned the portal, we have of course made sure that we also cater to the broader research community that may be interested in these unique materials.
Our new search features and updated facets allow for an even more efficient and effective access to relevant [datasets](/search?type=Dataset). We are proud that our previous data releases have already yielded new results: 2017 saw the publication of the [first scientific paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05842) using LHC data that was authored by external researchers, that is, ones not belonging to an LHC collaboration.

The success of CERN Open Data is made possible through working closely with various CERN-affiliated research collaborations and with external partners. We provide access to data and resources from the four big LHC collaborations: [ALICE](/about/alice), [ATLAS](/about/atlas), [CMS](/about/cms) and [LHCb](/about/lhcb).

We hope that you like our updated portal and appreciate any feedback and comments from your side. Please donâ€™t hesitate to [contact](mailto:opendata-support@cern.ch) us. You are also welcome to submit issues to [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/cernopendata/opendata.cern.ch/), where development of this portal takes place in the open.
