The CERN Open Data portal classifies each simulated dataset into one category or
subcategory. The scheme used here follows closely the
[CMS Physics Publications](https://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/publications/)
and
[ATLAS Physics Analysis Groups & Summary Plots ](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasPublic/WebHome#Physics%20Analysis%20Groups%20%20Summary)
structures.

## Description

Please find below the description of each category.

### B Physics and Quarkonia

Datasets for bottom- and charm-quark production:

- Heavy-quark hadron production, decay and properties
- Quarkonia properties

### Higgs Physics

Datasets related to Higgs physics including Standard Model and (N)MSSM

### Standard Model Physics

Datasets for jet, vector-boson production and production of vector-bosons with associated jets:

- Drell-Yan and Z/W production (including additional jets)
- Multi vector-boson production
- Forward and small-X physics (including diffractive processes)
- Processes for top-quark production
- Inclusive and multi-jet production

### Heavy-Ion Physics

Datasets for p–Pb, Pb–Pb collisions, and p–p reference set

### Beyond 2 Generations

Datasets for new heavy particles, including heavy resonances like Z&prime; and W&prime;, di-boson resonances, heavy partners of the top quark (with vector-like quark (VLQ) properties)

### Exotica

Datasets for non-supersymmetric physics beyond the Standard Model: extra dimensions, mini black holes, dark matter, extended Higgs models, compositeness

### Supersymmetry

Datasets for production of supersymmetric (SUSY) particles including scenarios for both R-parity conservation and violation. ((N)MSSM Higgs production is under _Higgs Physics_)

### Physics Modeling

Datasets for Monte Carlo generator studies and tuning, and for studies of systematic variations in different physics processes

A word of advice: the categorisation is done automatically, so some datasets may be miscategorised.
